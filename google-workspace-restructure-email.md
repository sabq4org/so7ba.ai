Dear Google Workspace Renewals Team,

I hope this email finds you well. I am Ali Alhazmi, administrator of the Google Workspace account for sabq.org (Account ID: 0168-0778-4495-3500). 

I was referred to you by our account manager, Semira Saleh, to discuss restructuring our current subscription to better align with our actual usage and business needs.

## Current Situation:
- **Current Plan:** 127 Business Plus licenses at $2,794/month
- **Active Users:** Only 99 out of 127 licenses are actively used
- **Unused Licenses:** 28 licenses (22% of our subscription)
- **Business Plus Requirements:** Only 3 users actually require Business Plus features
- **Outstanding Balance:** $10,102.93 ready to be settled upon restructuring confirmation
- **Current Contract:** Runs until January 7, 2027

## Proposed Restructure:

### Business Plus (3 licenses needed):
- aalhazmi@sabq.org (Admin - requires advanced security features)
- info@sabq.org (Customer service - needs enhanced collaboration tools)
- news@sabq.org (Editorial team - requires advanced sharing permissions)

### Business Starter (96 licenses needed):
- All remaining active users who primarily use Gmail, Drive, and basic collaboration tools

### Remove Completely:
- 28 unused/inactive licenses

## Business Justification:
1. **Cost Optimization:** This restructure would reduce our monthly costs from $2,794 to approximately $948/month (saving ~$22,152 annually)
2. **Right-sizing:** Most of our team members don't utilize Business Plus features like advanced security controls, enterprise endpoint management, or advanced meeting recordings
3. **Efficiency:** We're paying for premium features that 96% of our users don't need or use

## Implementation Timeline:
- **Preferred Date:** As soon as possible (immediate implementation)
- **Alternative:** Can be scheduled for the renewal date (January 7, 2027) if immediate changes aren't feasible
- **Flexibility:** We're open to discussing the best implementation approach that works for both parties

## Additional Information:
- **Organization:** sabq.org - Leading digital news platform in Saudi Arabia
- **Industry:** Media & Publishing
- **Current Usage:** Primarily email, file sharing, and basic collaboration
- **Future Growth:** We anticipate maintaining similar user levels (96-100 active users)

## Payment:
Once the restructuring is confirmed, we're ready to immediately settle the outstanding balance of $10,102.93 and proceed with the new billing structure.

## Request for Confirmation:
Could you please confirm:
1. Whether this restructure is possible under our current contract terms
2. The exact monthly cost breakdown for 3 Business Plus + 96 Business Starter licenses
3. Implementation timeline options
4. Any potential fees or considerations for the restructure
5. Process for settling the outstanding balance

I understand that our current annual plan runs until January 7, 2027, and I'd appreciate your guidance on the best path forward - whether changes can be made immediately or should be scheduled for the renewal date.

Please note: I'm sending this from an alternate email as our Workspace account currently has a billing hold affecting our primary domain email functionality.

## Contact Information:
- **Primary Contact:** Ali Alhazmi, Administrator
- **Phone:** +966564255999
- **Organization:** sabq.org
- **Alternate Email:** [Current sender email]
- **Best Time to Contact:** Sunday-Thursday, 9 AM - 5 PM (GMT+3)

I look forward to your response and guidance on implementing this cost-effective restructure that better serves our actual business needs.

Thank you for your time and assistance.

Best regards,

**Ali Alhazmi**
